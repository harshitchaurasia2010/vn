        Yes,You herd it right Perseverance has been launched on 30 June. It was launched by CCAFS Space Launch Complex 41 by NASA. The Satelite Launch Vehicle was made by Boeing. The Rover was made by NASA. It has been nicknamed "Percy". The name was suggested by a 13 year old boy. It  is a Mars rover manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for use in NASA's Mars 2020 mission. The rover was launched on 30 July 2020, at 7:50 a.m. EDT (11:50 UTC), and is expected to land on Mars on 18 February 2021.The Perseverance rover was designed with help from the Curiosity's engineering team, and they are similar to each other. Engineers redesigned the Perseverance rover wheels to be more robust than Curiosity's wheels, which have sustained some damage. The rover has thicker, more durable aluminum wheels, with reduced width and a greater diameter (52.5 centimetres (20.7 in) than Curiosity's 50 centimetres (20 in) wheels. The aluminium wheels are covered with cleats for traction and curved titanium spokes for springy support. The combination of the larger instrument suite, new Sampling and Caching System, and modified wheels makes Perseverance heavier than its predecessor, Curiosity, by 14% (899 kg to 1025 kg). The rover will include a five-jointed robotic arm measuring 2.1 metres (6 ft 11 in) long. The arm will be used in combination with a turret to analyze geologic samples from the Martian surface.

        <p>The rover's power generator (MMRTG) has a mass of 45 kilograms (99 lb) and uses 4.8 kilograms (11 lb) of plutonium dioxide as the source of steady supply of heat that is converted to electricity. The electrical power generated is approximately 110 watts at launch with little decrease over the mission time. Two lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are included to meet peak demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the MMRTG's steady electrical output levels. The MMRTG offers a 14-year operational lifetime, and it was provided to NASA by the US Department of Energy. Unlike solar panels, the MMRTG provides engineers with significant flexibility in operating the rover's instruments even at night and during dust storms, and through the winter season.Also travelling with Perseverance as a part of Mars 2020 is the Mars helicopter experiment, named Ingenuity. A solar-powered helicopter drone with a mass of 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb), it will be tested for flight stability and for its potential to scout the best driving route for the rover over a planned 30-day period. Other than cameras, it carries no scientific instruments.
          <p><h2>We are going to make Oxygen</h2><br>Yes,We will make oxygen on Mars. It may sound crazy. When I first heard about it I also thought it was impossible. It is called MOXIE. It is the size of a car battery. It was invented by "Michael Hecht". This device is also being carried by the Perseverance rover. <br><br><img src="A.jpg" alt="MOXIE" width="250" height="250" style="float:right">
